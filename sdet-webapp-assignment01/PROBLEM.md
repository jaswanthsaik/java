## SDET WebApp Assignment 01

### Problem Statement

We will develop an application which will get the news Id,title, author, description and content from the user using a form (JSP/HTML), add current timestamp and persist the data in Array List and display all news with details such as news id,news title, author, description and news content LocalDateTime.

### Expected solution
 A form containing five text fields for News ID, News Title, Author, Description, News content and a submit button
 When the user enters the News ID, Title, Author, Description, News Content and clicks on submit button, it gets stored in the array list and later render in tabular column.
 
### Following are the broad tasks:
1. Add a new news which should contain the News ID, Title, Author, Description, News Content.
2. Display the list of news from the array list. Each news should contain News ID, Title, Author, Description, News Content and created date. 


### Steps to be followed :

    Step 1: Fork and Clone the boilerplate in a specific folder in your local machine.
    Step 2: Create a web project inside the boilerplate folder and write the solution


#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment-solution-step1** of your local machine
     
    `git clone <BOILERPLATE-REPO>`

2. Navigate to assignment-solution-step1 folder

    `cd assignment-solution-step1`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote rm origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment-solution-step1` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin <CADET-REPO>`

6. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`

7. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
8. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

9. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed
