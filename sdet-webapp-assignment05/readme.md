## Seed code - Boilerplate for sdet-webapp-assignment05

### Assignment Step Description

In this Case study:we will create a RESTful application in a Spring Boot application.

Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that specifies constraints. 
In the REST architectural style, data and functionality are considered resources and are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), typically links on the Web.

Resources are manipulated using a fixed set of four create, read, update, delete operations: PUT, GET, POST, and DELETE. 
 - POST creates a new resource, which can be then deleted by using DELETE. 
 - GET retrieves the current state of a resource in some representation. 
 - PUT transfers a new state onto a resource. 

### Problem Statement

In this case study, we will develop a RESTful application using Spring boot with which we will operations such as register a user, create a News item and delete an news item, set a reminder to the news. Also, we will check the performance of the operations with the help of Postman API.

### Solution Step

        Step 1: Configure Postman in your Google Chrome
        Step 2: Use URI's mentioned in the controller to check all the expected operations using Postman.

### Following are the broad tasks:

 - Create a News, update a news, delete a news, get all news.

 

### Steps to be followed:

    Step 1: Clone the boilerplate in a specific folder on your local machine and import the same in your eclipse STS.
    Step 2: Add relevant dependencies in pom.xml file. 
        Note: Read the comments mentioned in pom.xml file for identifying the relevant dependencies. 
  
    Step 5: Define the data model class (News)
    Step 6: Create the Repository interfaces which should implement the JpaRepository interface.
    Step 7: See the methods mentioned in the service interface.
    Step 8: Implement all the methods of service interface in ServiceImpl.
    Step 9: Test each and every serviceImpl with appropriate test cases.
    Step 10: Write controllers to work with RESTful web services. 
    Step 11: Test each and every controller with appropriate test cases.
    Step 12: Check all the functionalities using URI's mentioned in the controllers with the help of Postman for final output.

#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment05-solution** of your local machine
     
    `git clone <GIT REPO LINK>`

2. Navigate to assignment-solution-step3 folder

    `cd assignment05-solution`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote rm origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment05-solution` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin <GIT REPO LINK>`

     **Note: {{yourUserName}} should be replaced by your userName from gitlab**

5. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`

6. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
7. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

8. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed
